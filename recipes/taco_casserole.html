    <h2>Here we will tell you how to cook this amazing taco casserole.</h2>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
     <ul>
         <li>Salt and pepper: Add to taste.</li>
         <li>Chili powder: You could try it with another type of chili powder like Ancho or mild New Mexican.</li>
         <li>Cumin: There’s not really a great substitute here but 1 tsp ground coriander will also add an earthy flavor.</li>
         <li>Black beans: Pinto beans are great alternative.</li>
         <li>Fire roasted tomatoes: Diced tomatoes with mild green chilies would be good too.</li>
         <li>Corn: This can be omitted or replaced with another vegetable like sautéed diced carrots, cauliflower or zucchini.</li>

         <li>Cilantro: Nothing really to substitute here, if you hate it just omit it.</li>
         <li>Cheddar and Monterey jack cheese: A pre-shredded Mexican blend cheese will taste great too.</li>
         <li>Corn tortillas: Flour tortillas could work but I wouldn’t be a fan (just like I don’t like enchiladas made with flour tortillas), so I guess it comes down to personal preference.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare oven and baking dish: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray a 13 by 9-inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Saute veggies: Heat a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper, saute 4 minutes. Scoot to the far side.</li>
    <li>Brown beef: Crumble in beef, season with salt and pepper. Let brown on bottom, then break up beef and continue to cook until browned. Drain fat.</li>
    <li>Bloom spices: Add garlic, chili powder and cumin and cook 1 minute longer.</li>
    <li>Add fillers: Stir in black beans, tomatoes, corn, water, lime juice, and cilantro and remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/3 of tortillas in baking dish: To assemble casserole, layer 10 tortilla halves along bottom of baking dish, work to cover whole bottom surface as best possible.</li>

    <li>Sprinkle with 1/3 of cheeses: Toss cheeses together and spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture over beef layer.</li>
    <li>Repeat process twice: Repeat this layering process with tortillas, beef filing and cheese two more times.</li>
    <li>Bake: Bake in preheated oven 20 minutes.</li>
